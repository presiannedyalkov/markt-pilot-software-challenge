# Functional Specifications
## FS Frontend

For a first prototype, two views should be created. In the overview, all chocolates should be displayed on one page including name, manufacturer, the lowest price per 100g, the average price per 100g and a direct link to the cheapest shop. In a details view, the name, brand and all market prices including the amount and shop link should be displayed for a selected chocolate.
